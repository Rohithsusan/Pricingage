# Pricingage
💳 Pricing Page – HTML & CSS

This project is a responsive pricing page built using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a clear, user-friendly pricing layout commonly used in SaaS and product websites.

The page showcases multiple pricing plans with well-structured cards, highlighting features, pricing details, and call-to-action buttons. The layout is built using Flexbox, ensuring proper alignment, spacing, and responsiveness across different screen sizes without using JavaScript.

Special attention was given to visual hierarchy, spacing consistency, hover effects, and card emphasis to guide users toward the most important plan.
